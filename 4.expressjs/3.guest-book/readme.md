# Guest Book

## Tasks:
create a guest book with a form to add a new entry and a list to show all entries in the homepage.
1. a page `/new` that contains a form to add a new entry
2. the homepage should display the list of entries
3. in the case of empty list, display a message instead of the list

side practice:
- use `curl` to send a post request to add a new entry
